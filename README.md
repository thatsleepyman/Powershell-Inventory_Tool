# Powershell-Inventory_Tool
This is a Powershell script I wrote for a summer job I had. It was used to easily take inventory of old Desktops that had to be replaced.

First off, these scripts were made by Stefan Meeuwessen to make taking Inventory of computers a lot easier.

Now off to the good part...

*NOTE:*
To be able to run Powershell scripts on any Computer be sure to open Powershell as Administrator and then open the scripts in Powershell ISE.

- First off run the script `Set-ExecutionPolicy.ps1` to allow scripts to be used on this machine.
> WARNING, this will make it possible to run ANY script! This can be very dangerous if abused!

- Then run `Inventory_Tool.ps1` to get the computer's data.
- This will create a folder with all your data in the same Directory as the `Inventory_Tool.ps1` script

Do with that data what ever you wish.

This is one of my first Powershell scripts so hopefully this script will have been useful to someone.
Also its totally fine to use for private or commercial reasons or to change the script to your liking and or needs.
Though it would be nice to get a __smidgen__ of credit for the script :)

Also, if you're curious on the development of this script, you might be interested in this Reddit post I made a long time ago:
