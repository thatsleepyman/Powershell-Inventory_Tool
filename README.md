# Powershell-Inventory_Tool
## Overview
This repository contains a Powershell script created by Stefan Meeuwessen for an inventory management task during a summer job. The script facilitates the process of taking inventory of old desktop computers that needed to be replaced.

## Purpose
The main purpose of this script is to simplify the inventory process for computers, making it more efficient and less error-prone.

## Prerequisites
Before running the Powershell scripts, please ensure that you have the necessary permissions. To do this:
1. Open Powershell as an administrator.
2. Run the script Set-ExecutionPolicy.ps1 to allow the execution of scripts on this machine.

*Note:* Enabling script execution can have security implications, as any script can be executed. Please be cautious and use this feature responsibly.

## How to Use
1. Run the script Inventory_Tool.ps1 after following the prerequisite steps.
2. This script will gather and organize the computer's data.
3. The script will create a folder in the same directory as Inventory_Tool.ps1 containing all the collected data.

Feel free to utilize the collected data as needed for your specific use case.

## Important Note
This script is one of the first Powershell scripts developed by the creator and has been shared here in the hope that it may be useful to others. You are welcome to use it for both private and commercial purposes or modify it to suit your specific requirements.

*Acknowledgment:* While it's not mandatory, giving credit to the original author (Stefan Meeuwessen) would be appreciated if you find the script useful.
